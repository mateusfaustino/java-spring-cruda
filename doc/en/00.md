# CRUDA - Project Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the web development project with Java for the CRUDA application! In this project, you will learn how to transform the CRUDA application into a web application, allowing users to register, list, update, and delete movies through a web browser, as well as authenticate themselves in the application. To achieve this goal, we will use web technologies, such as HTML integrated with Java code, the Spring framework for the web part, Thymeleaf for dynamic pages, Maven to manage the project, and MySQL as the database.

## Project Objectives

In this project, the main objectives are:

1. Develop a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for movies.
2. Implement user authentication rules.
3. Create a form for movie registration, including information such as name, duration, release year, and genre.
4. Integrate HTML pages with Java code using the Spring framework.
5. Use Thymeleaf to make HTML pages more dynamic.
6. Use Maven to organize and standardize the project structure and manage dependencies.
7. Connect the application to a MySQL database using the JPA specification.

## Prerequisites

To make the most of this project, it is important that you have prior knowledge in the following topics:

1. Basic knowledge of Java programming language.
2. Concepts of object-oriented programming.
3. HTTP protocol and its methods.
4. Basic understanding of databases, although it is not the main focus of this project.

If you lack sufficient knowledge in any of these topics, we recommend taking previous projects on the Alura platform to familiarize yourself with these concepts.

## Technologies Used

Throughout the project, we will use the following technologies:

1. Java: Main programming language for application development.
2. Spring Framework: Used to implement the web part, integrating HTML pages with Java code.
3. Thymeleaf: Technology for creating dynamic HTML pages.
4. Maven: Tool for managing dependencies and organizing the project structure.
5. MySQL: Relational database used to store movie information.
6. JPA (Java Persistence API): Specification that standardizes database access with Java.

## Project Structure

This is the first project of the course, in which we will create the system and develop basic functionalities. As we progress, we will implement new features and improve the application.

## Final Remarks

We hope this project will be a journey of learning and development for you! By the end of the project, you will have the knowledge to create a complete web application for movie registration, listing, updating, and deletion using Java and web technologies.
